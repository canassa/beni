# The JavaScript boundary — platforms, ports and `foreign`

**Status:** normative for M3, and the input M4's cache key needs. [`fast-compiler.md`](fast-compiler.md)
§3.1 settles that the language is pure with effects as values interpreted by a platform, and its
header states the stance this document implements: *Elm's walled garden, better equipped.*
[`research/13-the-javascript-boundary.md`](research/13-the-javascript-boundary.md) is the evidence
base; where this document asserts something without argument, that report has the citation.

The wall is not negotiable and nothing here relaxes it. **User code cannot call JavaScript.** What
this document does is make the interior richer, and give the privileged code that furnishes it the
mechanical checks Elm never had.

## 1. What the evidence settled before this document starts

Across fourteen compilers targeting JavaScript, **not one reads the JavaScript it binds to**, and no
shipped design lets user code call JavaScript while keeping the no-crash guarantee. Every mechanism
that is a *call* gives the guarantee up. Ports keep it structurally, and they are the efficient
frontier of what ships. Elm was right about the boundary.

What the evidence does *not* support is the three restrictions Elm stacked on top of ports, and each
one is why a capability you would expect to exist does not:

| Restriction | What it actually is | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| Only the core team may write privileged code | `isKernel` compares the package author against two GitHub organisation names | Also gates `effect module`, so nobody else can ship a new *kind* of effect even in pure Elm — which is why `localStorage` has no package |
| Ports carry a fixed list of types | `checkPayload` is a hardcoded whitelist; the codec is *generated from the declared type* | An ADT is trivially codec-able and is excluded only because the generator was never generalised |
| Ports are the only route | — | The recommended payload, an opaque JSON value, compiles to `identity` with no validation at all |

None of Evan's four stated reasons for the author restriction — reliability, portability, security,
code size — is a property of *who wrote the code*. Each is a property of what the code does, how it
is distributed, or what it compiles to. That is the opening this document walks through.

## 2. Three privilege levels

| Level | Who | May write |
|---|---|---|
| **Ordinary module** | anyone | no `foreign`, no port declarations, no platform entry point |
| **Platform package** | anyone, by declaring itself one in its manifest | `foreign` values, hosted effects, the `Program` type and `main`'s shape |
| **Core** | this repository | the same as a platform package; core is simply the platform-independent one |

**Privilege is a role with a checked contract, not an author list.** A platform package is an
ordinary package that anyone may publish; what makes it privileged is a manifest key, and what makes
it *safe* is §4's checks, which Elm does not perform. The security argument moves from the compiler
to distribution — which is where it already rests in every other language in the survey, Elm
included, since a whitelisted author is a distribution fact wearing a compiler's clothes.

`foreign` in an ordinary module stays `foreign_outside_core`, renamed to `foreign_outside_platform`
now that core is not the only privileged package.

## 3. Ports: the user-facing boundary

Ports stay, asynchronous, and are the only way user code reaches the outside world.

**The payload widens to any type the compiler can generate a codec for.** This is the change that
removes the most-cited friction without touching the safety argument, because the safety comes from
*generating* the codec, not from the list. Admitted: everything Elm admits, plus **ADTs and records
of admitted types**, which are a closed set of constructors with known argument types and therefore
trivially encodable. Still refused, for reasons that really are about safety: functions, type
variables, extended records, and anything containing a foreign type.

**The generated decoder carries a depth bound.** Machine-generated deserializers are themselves a
crash site — the report cites stack-exhaustion advisories against generated decoders in two other
ecosystems — so a decoder that recurses past the bound fails as a value rather than as a stack
overflow. This is the same discipline as the checker's guards: report, never poison silently.

**Ports stay asynchronous and no synchronous variant is added.** A synchronous call means a foreign
frame on the beni stack, a throw landing in the middle of `update`, and host callbacks into user
code, which is the one failure class nothing can catch. The ergonomic complaint is real and the
answer is not synchrony but **correlation**: core ships the request/response layer that three Elm
community packages each had to rebuild, as a `Task`-shaped API over one port pair. The cost is one
frame of latency, permanently, and it is worth stating plainly rather than discovering.

## 4. `foreign` in a platform package, and the checks Elm lacks

A `foreign` declaration binds to a sibling JavaScript file, one export per foreign value, under the
same name — already specified in `language.md` §5.4 and load-bearing for §7 below.

Three checks run at build time, and all three are things Elm does not do:

1. **The type must be one of exactly two shapes.** Either (a) a total pure function over
   already-admitted types, or (b) an effect value — `Task e a`, `Cmd msg`, `Sub msg`. Nothing else.
   The dangerous shape is a `foreign` that is neither: `foreign now : Float` would break dead-code
   elimination, common-subexpression reasoning, `lazy` chunk assignment and M4's split between a
   declaration's type and its value. The compiler cannot verify *which* it is, but it can verify the
   type, and the type is what the rest of the pipeline reasons from. All 65 of core's current
   foreign values are shape (a); every capability in §6 is shape (b). `Debug.log` is the one
   deliberate violation, as it is in Elm.
2. **The sibling file must export exactly the declared names** — no more, no fewer.
3. **The sibling file's references must be covered by its own imports.** §7.1 explains why this is
   what keeps elimination declaration-granular.

### 4.1 The recipe for privileged code, written down and tested

The guarantee lives or dies in privileged code, and Elm's own has holes: a core package declares a
result type whose quantified error variable claims infallibility while its implementation listens for
an event that fires on failure too, so `null` arrives typed as a string and the next operation
throws. Well-typed code crashes. The organisation Elm's own front page cites for "no runtime
exceptions" was shipping thousands a day and fixed it by forking three core packages. **Trust is not
a mechanism.**

So the recipe is a written contract, not a convention:

- Address foreign objects by value; never hold a reference across an effect boundary.
- Marshal every result to plain data before it crosses back.
- Every failure the specification defines is a constructor in the result type, not an exception.
- Every privileged entry point is wrapped in `try`/`catch`.

The last one is not optional and the reason is typed: an uncaught foreign throw can alter a value in
a way its type forbids, which is unsoundness rather than a crash. Gleam's core package documents
exactly this when declining to make its promise type generic over its error.

**Testable form: one corpus scenario per capability that forces the failure path and asserts a value
comes back.** A capability without that scenario is not finished. This is the discipline whose
absence produced the bug above, in the codebase that invented the wall.

## 5. `main`, and what a platform provides

**`main` is a platform-owned opaque `Program`.** Its type is a platform fact, so M3 resolves it per
platform rather than hardcoding one, and a platform may offer more than one entry point.

Anything the platform manages is handed to `init` as a value **no other code can construct** — the
unforgeable-capability trick. A user cannot fabricate a database handle or a socket; they can only
use the one they were given, which is what makes a capability grantable and revocable rather than
ambient.

Two platforms ship with the compiler:

- **Browser**: The Elm Architecture. `init`, `update`, `view`, `subscriptions`, ports.
- **Node**: worker-shaped, plus an exit code. This is the platform the test suite's second boundary
  runs against — compile a program, run the emitted JavaScript, assert what it printed — so it is
  not a nicety, it is what makes codegen testable at all.

## 6. The capability roadmap

What "better equipped" concretely means. Each entry is a capability Elm walls off, brought inside the
wall as a typed platform or core capability, with the typing that keeps well-typed code from
crashing.

**First: `Intl` and time.** Every failure defined by the internationalisation specification is
argument validation, so it moves into smart constructors at **zero runtime cost** — the validation
happens once, at construction, and the constructed value is then total. It is the capability Elm most
conspicuously lacks, and its sanctioned workaround demonstrably reintroduces crashes into the
virtual-DOM patch. It also establishes the validated-newtype pattern that every later capability
reuses.

Then, in rough order of how well the typing is understood: typed arrays and binary data; `fetch` and
streaming; `localStorage` and structured storage; Web Workers; direct DOM access beyond the virtual
DOM. Each needs its own analysis of what its failure modes are and whether they are all constructors;
none is admitted on the grounds that it would be convenient.

## 7. What this costs the rest of the design

### 7.1 Dead-code elimination stays declaration-granular

Elm solved the hard half of this and then lost it to granularity. A kernel JavaScript file is not
opaque to Elm's compiler: it is a template parsed into chunks, and every variable reference becomes a
real edge in the same whole-program graph the traversal from `main` walks. **A whole-program compiler
can see through its own foreign code precisely because that code is written in a dialect the compiler
reads, which is why no bundler can.** But every kernel file is keyed to *one* graph node, so reaching
one function pulls in the whole file. Module-granular tree shaking reappears exactly where §9.1
exists to beat it, and the byte attribution shows the cost from the other side: roughly 45% of Elm's
TodoMVC bundle is hand-written runtime.

**One export per foreign value is one graph node per foreign value**, which is why §5.4 already
specifies it. What must be added is the dependency half: Elm recovers it by parsing markers in its
template dialect; beni recovers it from the sibling file's own `import` statements, because we emit
ES modules and can simply read them. Hence check 3 in §4 — **a sibling file whose exports reference
anything not reachable from its own imports is a build error.**

### 7.2 Purity, and therefore elimination's correctness

§9.1's exactness rests on purity, and a `foreign` declaration is where that proof is assumed rather
than derived. The exposure is smaller than it looks, because §3.1 already decided effects are values:
a `foreign` of effect type is pure to *evaluate* by construction, and its interpretation happens in
the platform, which is the one place impurity is expected. §4's two-shape rule is what keeps the
assumption to that. Elm reached the same reasoning independently — its port error text refuses
functions because *Elm optimizations assume there are no side-effects*.

### 7.3 The M4 interface firewall is unaffected, but the cache key grows

Foreignness is already one bit in the interface record, derived from source text, and nothing about
the JavaScript appears there — so the interface stays a pure function of the `.beni` source, which is
the firewall's requirement.

What changes is the cache key: **it must include the content hash of the sibling JavaScript file**, an
input hash exactly like the source bytes. Editing a sibling file then invalidates that module's own
emit unit and nothing else, not a single dependent's declaration type. That is strictly better than
Elm, where kernel code lives inside the package and any change re-runs the package build. One
requirement to state now rather than debug later: **M4's `stat` fast-path must cover sibling files**,
not only `.beni` files.

## 8. Milestones

- **B1 — the platform contract in the compiler.** The manifest key that marks a platform package;
  `foreign_outside_platform`; the three build-time checks of §4; `Program` as a platform-owned opaque
  type; `main` resolved per platform. No JavaScript is emitted yet, so this lands with M3's front
  half and is testable through diagnostics alone.
- **B2 — the Node platform and core's JavaScript.** The sibling files for core's 65 foreign values,
  the Node platform, and with them the test suite's second boundary: compile, run under Node, assert
  what it printed. **This is the milestone that makes M3 testable**, and it should land before the
  optimiser rather than after.
- **B3 — ports.** The codec generator widened to ADTs and records, the depth bound, the
  request/response correlation layer, and a corpus scenario per port shape.
- **B4 — the browser platform**, The Elm Architecture over B3's ports.
- **B5 — `Intl` and time**, the first capability brought inside the wall, and the validated-newtype
  pattern every later one reuses.

## Appendix — what is deliberately not done

- **User-writable `foreign`.** It has never been made safe in any of the fourteen languages surveyed,
  and the wall is the product.
- **A synchronous port variant.** Three independent mechanisms in Elm exist to prevent it, and the
  failure class it admits is the one nothing can catch.
- **A synchronous escape hatch "just for core".** Core is where the bugs in §4.1 were.
- **Settling for opaque-JSON-only ports.** That is the status quo, and it is the *unchecked* path.
