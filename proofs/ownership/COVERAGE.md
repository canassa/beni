# T1–T59 coverage audit

The source is `docs/thesis/ownership/ch-soundness.tex`, Table 6.2, including
all named variants, and fifth-review/response. **This is core coverage, not complete thesis coverage.** The applicable pending
core examples from the previous audit are now implemented. Exclusions below
name the absent language/runtime boundary rather than replacing it with a claim.
“Projection tested” records a smaller ordinary-core ownership obligation and
never claims to test the omitted runtime/module/library boundary. No full
TEA/renderer example is an exact test of this core.

Tests are in `Ownership/Fixtures.lean`; each keeps the table's intended
accept/reject verdict. Accepted tests run both interpreters, comparing finalValue
and every ordinary read and external observer snapshot. Same-program reuse across projections is intentional and listed
here; it is not evidence for unimplemented wrappers/algorithms.

| ID | Status | Variants and exact boundary |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | projection tested | Argument alias, read-capture holder, fold with source=accumulator, and higher-order g callback capture all rejected. insertAt itself is projected to push (same consumed spine); no insertion primitive exists. |
| T2 | core tested | Read snapshot before push accepted; no optimizer exists in core, so A5 optimization claim untested. |
| T3 | core tested | Explicit shared root, ordinary publishing call and traversal publishing callback rejected. Frozen generated empty-list publishing regression also rejects; dropping traversal escape transfer produces an externalReads disagreement. |
| T4 | out of scope | Event payload/model handover P6 absent. |
| T5 | projection tested | Repeated consuming closure rejected; Result.andThen call-count positions absent. |
| T6 | out of scope | Task.join/runtime unknown retained results absent. |
| T7 | core tested | Returned mk closure reads captured list after push; rejected. Direct live read-only capture also rejected. |
| T8 | core tested | A returned factory once closure called twice; B once function captured by wrapper then mapped many times; C consuming closure stored at record field and called twice: all rejected. Earlier direct-call projections retained. |
| T9 | out of scope | Implicit eq dispatch and prohibition on writing eq declarations absent. |
| T10 | core tested | Duplicated record fields inside list rejected on scoped element write. |
| T11 | core tested | Ordinary concatRows traverses/pushes right-hand elements into left spine; focused write to transferred element while right source retained rejected. Earlier shallow-copy projection retained. |
| T12 | projection tested + recursion | Recursive appendTo scalar-counter/list-accumulator loop returns and consumes its list argument; original list retained, rejected. Original rest-pattern recursion is represented by scalar recursion, because list patterns are absent. |
| T13 | out of scope | View borrowed-entry protocol and concat alternative absent. |
| T14 | core tested; TEA excluded | Fresh init builds a record/list per ordinary call; two independent calls, one edited while the other retained, accepted. Reset and TEA entry contract absent. |
| T15 | core tested | Ordinary Library.foldl callback returns source element; later push with source live rejected. |
| T16 | out of scope | Module/interface cache invalidation absent. |
| T17 | core tested | compareLengths xs (push xs), retained tuple/record holder, and model.todos old/new record all rejected. Scalar compare is explicit because list comparison dispatch absent. |
| T18 | out of scope | List views, cached $plain and header representation absent. |
| T19 | out of scope | Opaque slot boundary absent. |
| T20 | out of scope | Command escape and TEA entry fixpoint absent. Traversal escape supplement is not this protocol. |
| T21 | projection tested | Explicit shared root rejects write; TEA init/reset model absent. |
| T22 | out of scope | Task.join wrapper and runtime retained values absent. |
| T23 | core tested | Closure returns captured list; later closure use blocks write through returned alias. |
| T24 | core tested | Ordinary map callback repeatedly returns capture; nested consuming focus rejected. |
| T25 | core tested | upTo scalar self-recursion returns captured acc then pushes recursive result; calling same closure again rejected (once recursive closure). |
| T26 | core tested | give returns captured consuming push1 closure; f call while give still live, then give/call again, rejected. |
| T27 | out of scope; many-call projection tested | Runtime handler entry contract absent. T8 B tests ordinary captured-once wrapper at map many-call position, not runtime handler retention. |
| T28 | out of scope | Markup opaque handler retention absent; ordinary closure projection covered T7. |
| T29 | out of scope | Command batch, send and reentrant update absent. |
| T30 | projection tested; TEA excluded | Independent init calls produce distinct record/list models; one written while second retained, accepted (same program as T14). Mounting, sandbox and update entry analysis absent. |
| T31 | projection tested | Consuming closure called twice rejected; source forward local binding not expressible in evaluation-order ANF. |
| T32 | projection tested | Dictionary key/value same cell modeled by two record fields in list; actual Dict algorithm absent. |
| T33 | projection tested | Retained old list rejects write, shallow copy of Int list accepted. Stack front/pattern/version loop absent. |
| T34 | out of scope | Borrowed send protocol P6 absent. |
| T35 | out of scope | Renderer reads/write invalidation P7 absent. |
| T36 | out of scope | Row rendering groups and event invalidation absent. |
| T37 | core tested; renderer excluded | Ordinary initialize creates three independent rows of three cells, ordinary update callback sets a row column, accepted. Earlier nested focus retained; rendering absent. |
| T38 | out of scope | Send, suspension and subsequent model write absent. |
| T39 | out of scope | DOM event bubbling and listener current-read protocol absent. |
| T40 | core tested | Distinct list-record fields; scoped callback constructs record with one pushed field, accepted. TEA entry iteration absent. |
| T41 | projection tested; TEA excluded | History list retains shallow-copied previous list; indexed restore alias then edit rejected, copying restored previous then editing accepted. Entry-state undo/history merging absent; these are ordinary restored-holder checks. |
| T42 | core tested | Ordinary map over id/tags records conditionally pushes tags or returns original card; independently built cells accepted, repeated tags cells rejected. |
| T43 | core tested with precision limit | Ordinary concat loop and foldl rows construction based on accumulator accepted. Consuming row-based fold with source retained rejected. Reverse-order foldr implemented by range/indexed reads and prepend concat, also rejected, but conservative many-call captured-consumption check fires before thesis Dead edge. |
| T44 | out of scope | Dictionary lookup/keyed update and Maybe data absent; no asserted Dict rule substituted. |
| T45 | out of scope | Command retained capture precision across TEA arms absent. |
| T46 | core tested | Shared/captured conditional accumulator branches rejected; borrowed element result then later push rejected; List.isEmpty projection via length with zero/nonzero branch returning row or pushing acc, with rows retained, rejected. |
| T47 | projection tested; release/renderer excluded | Transparent one-field Column record under list focus edited by push and wrapped again, accepted. Erased constructor identity and renderer release protocol absent. |
| T48 | projections tested | Duplicate versus distinct transparent record slots in list rejected/accepted. Opaque module summaries and Conduit entry protocol absent. |
| T49 | out of scope | Recursive data representatives and across-level exclusivity absent. |
| T50 | out of scope | Borrowed send-message writes and parking absent. |
| T51 | out of scope | Dictionary algorithm and empty dictionary special representation absent; both variants untested. |
| T52 | projections tested | Retained spine alias rejected; shallow copied Int spine accepted. Exact filter identity and entry fixpoint absent. |
| T53 | core tested; TEA excluded | Explicit shared list rejects write; initializer-function alternative builds fresh record/list per call, accepted (T14 program). Top-level declaration/module and TEA entry protocol absent. |
| T54 | out of scope | Markup structure-hole invalidation absent. |
| T55 | projection tested; exact dispatch out of scope | Explicit declaration call with aliased operands rejected; where evidence/implicit static method dispatch absent. |
| T56 | projection tested; schema out of scope | Duplicate fields from record constructor rejected on focused write. Actual schema parse/mapping algorithm absent. |
| T57 | core tested | Distinct/repeated inner cells tested both by scoped focus and ordinary Library.update wrappers with bumpHead callback: accepted/rejected respectively. Separate repeated-outer-row case builds internally distinct row, rows=[row,row], then nested ordinary update: rejected. |
| T58 | projection tested; renderer excluded | Scalar at read computes index before set; accepted with equal traces. removeAt/indexOf and renderer protocol absent. |
| T59 | core tested; schema excluded | Initialize/map internally shared fresh results rejected, distinct variants accepted. Frozen v1 map/initialize and v3 deeper tower controls disagree under oldFreshRule and corrected rejects. Schema mapping absent. |

## Explicit general limits

The core has integer zero/nonzero branches, positional record constructor and
projection, scalar self-recursion, closures and four structured primitives.
There is no record-update surface syntax, opaque/recursive type, list view or
list-pattern syntax, effects/fibers, TEA entry analysis, renderer, release
identity rewriting, implicit method dispatch or dictionary/schema implementation.
The checker explicitly rejects higher-order recursive actuals and recursive
changes to tracked shape/exclusivity; these are implementation limits rather
than new thesis rules (Ch. 3 demand/summary contracts; Ch. 4 inference; Ch. 6
soundness/derived-contract obligations). No excluded runtime or language-boundary variant is reported as passed. The broadened campaigns reach higher-order-recursion `limit:` rejections,
reported separately; this does not prove recursive contracts universally derivable.

The fixed suite has 74 intended verdict tests. Each independently typechecks;
accepted tests compare the complete Trace, including externally retained roots.
The traversal escape defect is repaired. Frozen controls demonstrate both
freshness-only and missing-transfer implementations accept an actual mismatch,
while the corrected checker rejects. No verdict was changed to match a checker.

## Positive/library observations and remaining exclusions

Ordinary declarations for map, initialize, foldl and update run in the fixtures
and generated pipelines; no library-aware checker branch was added. The suite
now includes fresh independent initialization (T14/T30/T53), conditional map
editing (T42), construction folds (T43), exact empty-accumulator conditional
(T46), scalar recursion (T12/T25), returned/captured once wrappers (T8/T26),
and ordinary nested update calls (T57). These are executable observations,
not universal library theorems. T43 reverse fold is rejected by a conservative
many-call rule before the intended final Dead edge, an explicit precision limit.

T6/T22 need runtime Task.join and unknown-origin values; using shared would
exercise Unescaped instead of Known. T44/T51 require dictionary/Maybe algorithms
and the empty-dictionary representation. T49 needs recursive data representatives;
scalar recursion is not that boundary. T59's schema variant requires schema
parsing/mapping. The TEA/send/renderer/opaque/module/release exclusions in the
table remain excluded, and no full application is claimed to be reproduced.
There are no remaining applicable pending core fixtures from the previous audit.
The current generated higher-order recursion family intentionally exercises
`limit: higher-order recursive argument`; campaign logs count these separately.
