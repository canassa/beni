## 2026-09-16 02:27 CEST — five review defects in the n-ary function types change

**What I did**

Fixed the five defects a read-only review found in the uncommitted n-ary
function types change, each with a corpus fixture proved to fail before the fix
by stashing it.

- **A tuple of function types was silently misparsed.** `parseTypeAtom`'s `(`
  branch called `finishType`, whose result is a whole `Type`, so the result
  re-entered `parseTypeItems` and ate the next top-level comma:
  `( Int -> Int, Bool -> Bool )` parsed as `Int -> ((Int, Bool) -> Bool)` with no
  diagnostic. `finishType` now takes a `ResultMode`; inside parentheses the
  result is `.single` — an arrow chain whose links are single `TypeApp`s, never a
  comma list — and a comma after it is `arrow_in_tuple_element`. Fixture
  `parse/bad/ArrowInTupleElementAllFunctions`. The existing
  `ArrowInTupleElement`'s span moved from the closing `)` to the comma, which is
  what its own message ("and then found a comma after it") points at.
- **The nesting guard no longer charged for a parenthesised type.**
  `parseTypeItems → parseTypeApp → parseTypeAtom → parseTypeItems` is a cycle
  with no `enter()` in it, so 30 000 nested `(` in a type were accepted in
  silence where 4096 used to report. `enter()`/`leave()` at the head of the `(`
  branch. Fixture pair `check/depth/TypeParens{Ok,Deep}` and its entry in
  `generate.sh`: measured 4095 clean, 4096 reports, the same boundary as the
  expression case.
- **`Render` printed a tuple element that re-read as a different type.** The
  `.tuple` arm wrote elements at `.top`, so `( (Int -> Int), Int )` printed as
  `( Int -> Int, Int )` — which the parser reads as a 2-ary function. `.arg`
  parenthesises exactly the function-typed elements. Fixture
  `check/bad/TupleElementOfFunctionType`.
- **The `given == 0` shortcut in `Solve.call` ran before the callee was
  inspected**, so a constructor of arity ≥ 1 written bare in a pattern got a raw
  `type_mismatch` instead of §8.3's arity message. Now
  `given == 0 and st.paramCount(info.callee) == 0`. Fixture
  `check/args/ConstructorBareInPattern`.
- **`Lower.Input.birs` and `.provenance` were write-only** once `externalArity`
  went, and `birs`' doc comment told M4 that arity is not in the interface — which
  this change discharges. Both fields, their allocation loops in `js/Lower.zig`
  and `js/Emit.zig`, and the note are gone.

**What I learned**

- **`language.md` §3 settles `( Int -> Int, Bool -> Bool )` against the tuple
  reading, and the grammar alone does not.** `TypeAtom := '(' TypeApp (','
  TypeApp)+ ')'` makes a tuple's elements `TypeApp`s, which cannot contain an
  arrow, so the 2-tuple of functions is not derivable at all; but `'(' Type ')'`
  with `Type := TypeParams '->' Type` *is* derivable and is exactly what the
  parser was doing. What decides it is the Types table and the diagnostic's own
  text — "I read the `->` … and then found a comma after it" — so the answer is
  the diagnostic, not the tuple and not the nested function.
- The price is that `(a, b -> c, d -> e)`, legal by a literal reading of the
  grammar, is now `arrow_in_tuple_element` too. That is the right trade: nobody
  writes it, it is exactly as confusing as the shape the message is about, and
  `(a, b -> (c, d -> e))` says it. Outside parentheses the greedy reading stays,
  because there is no tuple to be confused with there.
- **A guard that is reached through one entry point is not reached at all once a
  refactor adds a second.** The depth charge lived in `parseType`; the new `(`
  branch called `parseTypeItems` directly and the cycle closed behind the guard's
  back. `check/depth`'s pairing — a fixture UNDER the limit that must pass and one
  OVER it that must report — is the only shape of test that sees this, because
  the failure mode is silence.
- `.l_brace` needs no `enter()`: every path into a record type body goes through
  `parseRecordTypeFields → parseType`, which charges. Said so in a comment, since
  the asymmetry with `.l_paren` otherwise looks like the same oversight.
